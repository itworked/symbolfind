UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED
1. THE COMPLETE INSTALLATION SHALL BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADA STANDARDS FOR 
ACCESSIBLE DESIGN. REFER TO THE ADA GUIDELINES FOR ALL CONFIGURATION DETAILS ON 
THIS PAGE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
2. CIRCUIT NUMBERS ARE SHOWN FOR CIRCUIT IDENTIFICATION.  CIRCUITING SHALL AGREE 
WITH NUMBERING ON THE PANEL PROVIDED. COMMON NEUTRALS MAY NOT BE USED FOR 
BRANCH CIRCUITS. BALANCE THE LOAD ON PANEL AS EVENLY AS POSSIBLE BETWEEN EACH 
PHASE.
3. LIFE SAFETY, CRITICAL, EQUIPMENT BRANCH WIRING FOR FEEDERS AND BRANCH CIRCUITS 
SHALL BE ROUTED IN SEPARATE RACEWAY, JUNCTION BOXES, PULL BOXES, AND CABINETS.  
WIRING FOR EACH BRANCH SHALL BE INDEPENDENT FROM OTHER BRANCHES, INCLUDING 
THE NORMAL BRANCH.
4. FLUSH MOUNT ALL LIGHTING CONTROL DEVICES AT +42" FROM FLOOR (CENTERLINE 
DIMENSION), EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE NOTED.
5. FLUSH MOUNT ALL DUPLEX RECEPTACLES AND TECHNOLOGY OUTLETS AT +18" FROM 
FLOOR (CENTERLINE DIMENSION), EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE NOTED.  RECEPTACLES AND 
OUTLETS MAY BE SURFACE MOUNTED WHEN CONDUIT IS SPECIFIED EXPOSED. MOUNT 
EXTERIOR LOCATED RECEPTACLES WITH WHILE-IN-USE COVERS AT +20" FROM FINISHED 
GRADE (CENTER DIMENSIONS) TO MAINTAIN INSTALLATION ADA COMPLIANCE.
6. ALL MATERIALS USED TO SEAL PENETRATIONS OF FIRE RATED WALLS AND FLOORS SHALL 
BE TESTED AND CERTIFIED AS A SYSTEM PER ASTM E814 STANDARDS FOR FIRE TESTS OF 
THROUGH-PENETRATION FIRESTOPS. REFER TO DIVISION 7 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
AND REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO FIRESTOPPING. 
7. INSTALL ALL WALL MOUNTED FIRE ALARM NOTIFICATION DEVICES AT 90" ABOVE FINISHED 
FLOOR OR 6" BELOW THE CEILING, WHICHEVER IS LOWER, EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE 
NOTED.  HEIGHT SHALL BE MEASURED TO THE TOP OF THE DEVICE.
8. CONTRACTOR SHALL COORDINATE THE LOCATION OF ALL CEILING MOUNTED DEVICES AND 
EQUIPMENT WITH LUMINAIRES, SPRINKLER, AND CEILING DIFFUSERS.  CENTER ALL DEVICES 
IN CEILING TILE PATTERN.  SMOKE DETECTORS,CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS, AND 
OCCUPANCY/VACANCY SENSORS SHALL BE LOCATED NO CLOSER THAN 3 FEET TO AN AIR 
SUPPLY DIFFUSER OR RETURN GRILLE. CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS SHALL BE LOCATED 
10 PLUS FT FROM FIRE PLACES, COOKING, AND SIMILAR FUEL-BURNING APPLIANCES.
9. CONTRACTOR SHALL VERIFY ALL FURNITURE, MODULAR FURNITURE, AND EQUIPMENT 
LOCATIONS WITH ARCHITECTURAL PLANS, ELEVATIONS, AND REVIEWED SHOP DRAWINGS.  
PRIOR TO MAKING THE ACTUAL ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION, THIS CONTRACTOR SHALL 
ADJUST RECEPTACLES, OUTLETS, OR CONNECTION LOCATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE 
FURNITURE AND/OR EQUIPMENT.
10. ELECTRICAL AND TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT SHALL BE MOUNTED TO AVOID IMPEDANCE OF, 
OPERATION OF, AND/OR ACCESS TO ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.  ALL 
MOUNTING OF ELECTRICAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, ON EQUIPMENT 
SUPPLIED BY ANOTHER CONTRACTOR, SHALL BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE OTHER 
CONTRACTOR.
11. CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OPENINGS REQUIRED IN WALLS.  ALL 
OPENINGS SHALL BE REPAIRED TO MATCH EXISTING BY A QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR AT THE 
EXPENSE OF THIS CONTRACTOR.  ALL CONDUITS THROUGH WALLS SHALL BE GROUTED OR 
SEALED INTO OPENINGS.
12. EACH CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THEIR ACTIONS TO THE 
WALLS, FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS. THE CONTRACTOR WHOSE WORK CAUSES DAMAGE 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PATCHING TO MATCH ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION, FIRE RATING, AND 
FINISH. 
13. REFER TO ARCHITECTURAL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN, ELECTRICAL, TECHNOLOGY 
AUDIO/VISUAL, AND OTHER ELECTRICAL PLANS FOR EXACT LOCATIONS OF ALL CEILING 
MOUNTED DEVICES, OTHER THAN SPRINKLERS. 
14. ELECTRICAL IDENTIFICATION.  REFER TO SPECIFICATION SECTION 26 05 53 FOR COLOR/LABEL 
REQUIREMENTS FOR  CONDUIT, BOX, CABLE/WIRE, AND EQUIPMENT.
ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION NOTES:
1. EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE SHOWN BASED ON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM FIELD 
SURVEYS, EXISTING BUILDING DOCUMENTS. CONTRACTOR SHALL REVIEW EXISTING 
CONDITIONS AND REPORT CONFLICTS. 
2. NOT ALL EXISTING EQUIPMENT, LUMINAIRES, AND CONDUIT ARE SHOWN. CONTRACTOR 
SHALL REVIEW EXISTING CONDITIONS AND REPORT CONFLICTS. 
3. CONTRACTOR SHALL REVIEW EXISTING CONDITIONS PRIOR TO FABRICATION OF CABLE 
TRAY, BUSWAY, CONDUIT RACKS, AND OTHER SYSTEMS. RISES AND DROPS MAY BE 
NECESSARY BECAUSE OF EXISTING FIELD CONDITIONS.
4. ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR SHALL REVIEW EXISTING CONDITIONS TO VERIFY ACCESSIBILITY 
TO THE AREAS OF THEIR WORK INCLUDING WALLS, FLOOR, CEILINGS, CEILING TILES/GRID, 
AND ROOF.  ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE CUTTING, REMOVAL,  
PATCHING, AND REINSTALLATION OF AFFECTED AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR WORK BY 
COORDINATING WITH THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR OR QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR.  
5. WHERE EXISTING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE LOCATED IN AREAS THAT CONFLICT WITH NEW 
EQUIPMENT, PIPING, OR DUCTWORK TO BE INSTALLED, EACH CONTRACTOR SHALL EITHER 
ARRANGE NEW EQUIPMENT, CONDUIT, OR DUCTWORK IN SUCH A FASHION THAT IT DOES 
NOT CONFLICT WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS, OR REWORK EXISTING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS TO 
ALLOW FOR INSTALLATION OF NEW EQUIPMENT, PIPING, OR DUCTWORK.
ELECTRICAL RENOVATION NOTES:
THESE NOTES APPLY TO ALL ELECTRICAL SHEETS AND TRADES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
